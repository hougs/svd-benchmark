# SVD Benchmarking
This project is an attempt at comparing the performance various 
distrubted SVD implementations, under reasonable configurations
for their underlying frameworks:

* Mahout's [Lanczos' Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm) based SVD.
* Mahout's [Stochastic SVD](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4061) based SVD.
* Spark's Lanczos' Method based SVD solver.
